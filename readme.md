# [Budget App](https://raw.githack.com/tomzacchia/budget.io/master/index.html)
Budget.io is an applicaton made using HTML, CSS and JS and explores the concept of 
DOM manipulation using Vanilla JS. This project was created as part of the video series 
[The Complete Javascript Course 2019 by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

# Lessons learned
- Throughout working on this project it became evident that in the past I had taken a lot of advanced JS concepts for granted, 
such as closures, IIFEs, Modueles etc... Jonas does a great job of explaining these concepts in depth, which allowed me to make use 
of them throughout the application. What I enjoyed most about working on the application was the use of Modules, in particular how 
the use of Modules allows developers to separate concerns and isolate code.
